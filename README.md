[*SparkFun gator:microphone - micro:bit Accessory Board (SEN-15289)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15289)  

An I<sup>2</sup>C sensor for detecting sound with an electret microphone. The sensor measures the actual audio, amplitude envelope, and sound indication with an ADC (ADS1015).

Instead of using pin connections or requiring soldering, this product provides connection pads for a more kid freindly experience with alligator clips. The design intention of this product is to be used with the [gato:bit (v2)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15162), and the [micro:bit development board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14208).
