[*SparkFun gator:RTC - micro:bit Accessory Board (COM-15486)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15486)  

The gator:RTC is a supplemental data logging tool to be used in conjunction with the [gator:log](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15270), part of SparkFun's gator:bit series of gator-clippable accessories designed for easy interface with the micro:bit or other microcontrollers. This tool allows a student to focus more on the experiment than watching a thermometer or stopwatch.

Instead of using pin connections or requiring soldering, this product provides connection pads for a more kid freindly experience with alligator clips. The design intention of this product is to be used with the [gato:bit (v2)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15162), and the [micro:bit development board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14208).
